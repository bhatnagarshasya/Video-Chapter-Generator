**User**

analyse the whole project and its structure and then i will tell you what to do next

---

**Cursor**

I'll help analyze the project structure. Let me start by examining the contents of the workspace.


Let me check the README.md first to understand the project's purpose and functionality.


Let me also check the requirements.txt to understand the project dependencies:


Based on my analysis, this is a Video Chapter Generator project with the following structure and components:

1. **Core Components**:
   - `chapter_generator.py` (9.9KB): Main implementation file
   - `example.py` (1.3KB): Example usage script
   - `test_chapter_generator.py` (3.6KB): Test suite
   - `progress.py` (1.5KB): Progress tracking functionality
   - `exceptions.py` (638B): Custom exception definitions

2. **Output Files**:
   - `chapters_youtube.txt`: YouTube-formatted chapter markers
   - `chapters.srt`: SubRip subtitle format
   - `chapters.json`: JSON metadata with chapter information

3. **Key Features**:
   - Video analysis with audio extraction
   - Speech recognition using OpenAI's Whisper
   - Topic segmentation and transition detection
   - Multiple export formats (YouTube, SRT, JSON)
   - Progress tracking and error handling

4. **Dependencies**:
   - OpenAI Whisper for speech recognition
   - MoviePy for video processing
   - PyTorch for ML operations
   - NLTK for natural language processing
   - Other supporting libraries (numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

5. **Project Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - FFmpeg for video processing
   - CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
   - Various Python packages as listed in requirements.txt

The project appears to be a well-structured Python application that automatically generates chapter markers for videos by analyzing their content. It uses modern AI/ML techniques (Whisper for speech recognition) and provides multiple output formats for flexibility.

I'm ready to help you with any specific tasks or modifications you'd like to make to the project. What would you like to do next?

**User**

Is it possible that instead of video path i give this project youtube links and have it generate the output from that?
not instead i mean both should work

---

**Cursor**

Yes, we can modify the project to support both local video files and YouTube URLs. We'll need to add YouTube video downloading functionality using `pytube` or `yt-dlp` (I recommend `yt-dlp` as it's more actively maintained and has better features).

Let me first check the current implementation in `example.py` to see how we can integrate this:


Let me also check the main implementation file to see how we need to modify it:


I'll help you modify the project to support both local video files and YouTube URLs. Here's what we need to do:

1. First, let's add `yt-dlp` to the requirements.txt:


```pip-requirements
openai-whisper>=20231117
moviepy>=1.0.3
numpy>=1.24.0
torch>=2.0.0
transformers>=4.30.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.2
nltk>=3.8.1
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
tqdm>=4.65.0
pydub>=0.25.1
yt-dlp>=2023.12.30
```

2. Now, let's modify the `chapter_generator.py` to add YouTube support:

            raise VideoProcessingError(f"Failed to process video: {str(e)}")
// ... existing code ...
```

3. Finally, let's update the example.py to demonstrate both local and YouTube video processing:


```python
from chapter_generator import VideoChapterGenerator
import os
import argparse

def process_video(generator, video_path):
    """Process a video and generate chapters."""
    print(f"\nProcessing video: {video_path}")
    # Generate chapters
    chapters = generator.process_video(video_path)
    
    # Export in different formats
    print("\nExporting chapters...")
    generator.export_youtube_format(chapters, "chapters_youtube.txt")
    generator.export_srt(chapters, "chapters.srt")
    generator.export_json(chapters, "chapters.json")
    
    print("\nGenerated chapters:")
    for i, chapter in enumerate(chapters, 1):
        print(f"\nChapter {i}:")
        print(f"Title: {chapter['title']}")
        print(f"Time: {chapter['start_time']:.2f}s - {chapter['end_time']:.2f}s")
        print(f"Description: {chapter['description'][:100]}...")

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate video chapters from local video or YouTube URL')
    parser.add_argument('--video', '-v', help='Path to local video file')
    parser.add_argument('--youtube', '-y', help='YouTube video URL')
    parser.add_argument('--model', '-m', default='base', choices=['tiny', 'base', 'small', 'medium', 'large'],
                      help='Whisper model size (default: base)')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if not args.video and not args.youtube:
        print("Please provide either a local video file or a YouTube URL")
        parser.print_help()
        return
    
    # Initialize the chapter generator
    generator = VideoChapterGenerator(model_size=args.model)
    
    # Process local video if provided
    if args.video:
        if not os.path.exists(args.video):
            print(f"Error: Video file not found: {args.video}")
            return
        process_video(generator, args.video)
    
    # Process YouTube video if provided
    if args.youtube:
        process_video(generator, args.youtube)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now the project supports both local video files and YouTube URLs! Here's how to use it:

1. First, install the updated requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. You can now use the script in two ways:

For local video files:
```bash
python example.py --video "path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

For YouTube videos:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

You can also specify the Whisper model size:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --model small
```

The script will:
1. For YouTube videos: Download the video first
2. Extract audio from the video
3. Transcribe the audio using Whisper
4. Generate chapters based on the content
5. Export the chapters in three formats:
   - `chapters_youtube.txt`: YouTube chapter format
   - `chapters.srt`: SubRip subtitle format
   - `chapters.json`: JSON metadata with full chapter information

The script automatically handles cleanup of temporary files (downloaded YouTube videos and extracted audio) after processing.

Would you like me to explain any part of the implementation in more detail or help you test it with a specific video?

```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shellscript
python example.py --video "path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --model small
```

**Cursor**

I'll help you set up and run the project in a virtual environment. Here are the step-by-step commands:

1. First, let's create a virtual environment. Since you're on Windows, use these commands:


---

**User**

dont need you to run these commands just give them to me 

---

**Cursor**

Here are all the commands you need to run in sequence to set up and use the virtual environment:

1. Create the virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download required NLTK data:
```bash
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"
```

5. Now you can run the script with either a local video or YouTube URL:

For a local video:
```bash
python example.py --video "path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

For a YouTube video:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

Optional: You can specify the Whisper model size (tiny, base, small, medium, large):
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --model small
```

When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

Remember:
- Always activate the virtual environment before running the script
- The first run will download the Whisper model (about 1.5GB)
- Make sure you have FFmpeg installed on your system
- The script will create three output files: `chapters_youtube.txt`, `chapters.srt`, and `chapters.json`

```shellscript
python -m venv venv
```

```shellscript
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shellscript
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"
```

```shellscript
python example.py --video "path/to/your/video.mp4"
```

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
```

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" --model small
```

```shellscript
deactivate
```

It seems the packages weren't installed correctly in your virtual environment. Let's make sure you're in the virtual environment and install the packages again:

1. First, make sure you're in the virtual environment (you should see `(venv)` at the start of your command prompt). If not, activate it:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Then install the requirements again:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. If you still get the error, try installing moviepy separately:
```bash
pip install moviepy
```

4. You might also need to install FFmpeg if you haven't already. On Windows, you can install it using:
```bash
winget install ffmpeg
```
or
```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```

After installing these, try running the command again:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s"
```

If you still encounter any issues, please let me know what error you get and I'll help you resolve it.

```shellscript
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shellscript
pip install moviepy

Let's fix this step by step. It seems the virtual environment might not be activated or the packages weren't installed correctly.

1. First, make sure you're in the virtual environment. You should see `(venv)` at the start of your command prompt. If not, activate it:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Let's verify the installation of moviepy:
```bash
pip install moviepy --upgrade
```

3. Let's also verify all other requirements are installed correctly:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

4. You can verify the installed packages with:
```bash
pip list
```

If you're still getting the error after these steps, try these troubleshooting steps:

1. Deactivate and reactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Then reinstall the packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. If that doesn't work, try creating a fresh virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
rm -r venv
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After completing these steps, try running your command again:

Let's fix this step by step. I notice you're still getting the same error, which suggests the virtual environment might not be properly activated or the packages aren't installed correctly.

1. First, let's check if you're in the virtual environment. In your command prompt, you should see `(venv)` at the beginning. If you don't see it, activate the virtual environment:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. After activation, let's try installing moviepy specifically:
```bash
pip install moviepy
```

3. Then install all other requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. To verify the installation, run:
```bash
pip list
```
You should see `moviepy` in the list of installed packages.

If you're still getting the error, let's try a complete reset:

1. Deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

2. Delete the existing virtual environment:
```bash
rmdir /s /q venv
```

3. Create a new virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. Activate the new environment:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Upgrade pip:
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

6. Install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. Then try running your command again:
```bash
python example.py --video "2025-06-04 21-42-28.mkv"
```

If you're still getting the error after these steps, please let me know and also share the output of:
```bash
pip list
```
This will help me understand what packages are actually installed in your environment.

```shellscript
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

```shellscript
pip install moviepy
```

```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```shellscript
pip list
```

```shellscript
deactivate
```

```shellscript
rmdir /s /q venv
```

```shellscript
python -m venv venv
```

```shellscript

**User**

moviepy is there in pip list so error is from someplace else

---

**Cursor**

Let's check if there might be an issue with the Python path or if there are any other dependencies missing. Since moviepy is installed but we're still getting the error, let's try a few things:

1. First, let's verify the exact version of moviepy and its dependencies. Run:
```bash
pip show moviepy
```

2. Let's also try installing some of moviepy's core dependencies explicitly:
```bash
pip install decorator
pip install imageio
pip install imageio-ffmpeg
pip install proglog
pip install tqdm
pip install numpy
```

3. You can also try importing moviepy directly in Python to see if there's a more detailed error message:
```bash
python -c "from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip"
```

4. Another thing to check is if you have FFmpeg installed properly, as moviepy depends on it. You can verify FFmpeg installation by running:
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

If FFmpeg isn't installed, you can install it on Windows using:
```bash
winget install ffmpeg
```
or
```bash
choco install ffmpeg
```

After installing FFmpeg, you might need to restart your terminal/command prompt for the changes to take effect.

Try these steps and let me know what happens. If you still get an error, please share:
1. The output of `pip show moviepy`
2. The output of `ffmpeg -version`
3. Any error message you get when trying to import moviepy directly

This will help us pinpoint exactly where the issue is coming from.

```shellscript
pip show moviepy
```

```shellscript
pip install decorator
pip install imageio
pip install imageio-ffmpeg
pip install proglog
pip install tqdm
pip install numpy
```

```shellscript
python -c "from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip"
```

```shellscript
ffmpeg -version
```

```shellscript
winget install ffmpeg
```

```shellscript
choco install ffmpeg
```

---

**Cursor**

This is interesting - even though moviepy is in pip list, Python can't find the module. Let's try to fix this:

1. First, let's completely uninstall moviepy and its dependencies:
```bash
pip uninstall moviepy
pip uninstall decorator
pip uninstall imageio
pip uninstall imageio-ffmpeg
pip uninstall proglog
```

2. Then install moviepy again with the --no-cache-dir flag to ensure a fresh installation:
```bash
pip install moviepy --no-cache-dir
```

3. Let's also verify which Python interpreter is being used. Run:
```bash
where python
```

4. And check the Python path:
```bash
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

5. You can also try installing moviepy with the full path to pip:
```bash
python -m pip install moviepy --no-cache-dir
```

If you're still getting the error, there might be an issue with the virtual environment. Let's try creating a new one in a different location:

1. Deactivate current environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

2. Create a new virtual environment in a different directory:
```bash
python -m venv venv_new
```

3. Activate the new environment:
```bash
.\venv_new\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install the requirements in the new environment:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Try importing moviepy again:
```bash
python -c "from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip"
```

Please try these steps and let me know what happens. Also, it would be helpful to know:
1. The output of `where python`
2. The output of `python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"`

This will help us understand if there might be a Python path issue or if the virtual environment isn't being activated correctly.

```shellscript
pip uninstall moviepy
pip uninstall decorator
pip uninstall imageio
pip uninstall imageio-ffmpeg
pip uninstall proglog
```

```shellscript
pip install moviepy --no-cache-dir
```

```shellscript
where python
```

```shellscript
python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"
```

```shellscript
python -m pip install moviepy --no-cache-dir
```

```shellscript

```

```shellscript
python -m venv venv_new

this moviepy version is different help me install the version mentioned in the req file

---

**Cursor**

I see the issue. The requirements.txt specifies `moviepy>=1.0.3` but you have version 2.2.1 installed. Let's install the specific version:

1. First, uninstall the current version:
```bash
pip uninstall moviepy
```

2. Then install the version specified in requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install moviepy==1.0.3
```

3. After installation, verify the version:
```bash
pip show moviepy
```

4. Then try running your command again:
```bash
python example.py --video "2025-06-04 21-42-28.mkv"
```

If you still get the error, we might need to also ensure all the dependencies are at the correct versions. Let's try installing all requirements again with the exact versions:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

Let me know if you still encounter any issues after these steps.

```shellscript
pip uninstall moviepy
```

```shellscript
pip install moviepy==1.0.3
```

```shellscript
pip show moviepy
```

```shellscript
python example.py --video "2025-06-04 21-42-28.mkv"
```

```shellscript
pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir
```

these chapters that are generated have like a chapter length of 1 or 2 seconds thats not how long a chapter is , i mean how does that even make sense to you 
make changes a chapter should atleast have minimum of 1 minute of length.
also that doesnt mean that every chapter should just be 1 minute long it should be different lenghts as per the information that is analysed through the video

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right. The current implementation doesn't have a minimum chapter length, which can lead to very short, impractical chapters. Let's modify the `_generate_chapters` method in `chapter_generator.py` to enforce a minimum chapter length and make the chapter segmentation more meaningful.


```python
    def _generate_chapters(self, transcription: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Generate chapters from transcription with minimum length enforcement."""
        segments = transcription["segments"]
        if not segments:
            return []
            
        chapters = []
        MIN_CHAPTER_LENGTH = 60  # Minimum chapter length in seconds
        
        # Group segments into potential chapters
        current_chapter = {
            "start_time": segments[0]["start"],
            "end_time": segments[0]["end"],
            "text": segments[0]["text"],
            "segments": [segments[0]]
        }
        
        for segment in segments[1:]:
            # Check for topic transition and minimum length
            if (self._is_topic_transition(current_chapter["text"], segment["text"]) and 
                (segment["start"] - current_chapter["start_time"]) >= MIN_CHAPTER_LENGTH):

        return has_transition_word or content_change or has_time_indicator
```

I've made several important improvements to the chapter generation:

1. **Minimum Chapter Length**:
   - Added a `MIN_CHAPTER_LENGTH` constant set to 60 seconds (1 minute)
   - Chapters must be at least 1 minute long before they can be created
   - Short chapters are merged with adjacent ones

2. **Improved Topic Transition Detection**:
   - Added more transition words and phrases
   - Added time-based transition detection
   - Improved content change detection
   - Now checks both the end of the current chapter and start of the next for transitions

3. **Chapter Merging Logic**:
   - Added a post-processing step that merges very short chapters with adjacent ones
   - Maintains the natural flow of content while ensuring chapters are of reasonable length
   - Preserves the semantic meaning by combining related content

4. **Better Content Analysis**:
   - Now tracks segments within each chapter for better content analysis
   - Improved similarity calculation between segments
   - Added time-based indicators for better chapter boundary detection

These changes will result in:
- No chapters shorter than 1 minute
- More natural chapter breaks based on content
- Better preservation of topic coherence
- More meaningful chapter titles and descriptions

Try running the script again with your video, and you should see much more reasonable chapter lengths that better reflect the actual content structure of the video.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these parameters, such as changing the minimum chapter length or adding more transition words?

set a limit of 20 chapters as in it is not neccessary that this many should be there but if the video is long then there should be max of 20 chapters and it should cover the whole video , length of each chapter can variate so as to not make every chapter only 1 minute what i mean to say is even a video that exceeds 1200 seconds or 60 sec for 20 chapters should be included in those 20 chapters so then each chapter length can be different so as to accomodate the rest of the video

Great clarification! Here’s how I’ll update the logic:

- If the number of chapters exceeds 20, merge chapters so that the final count is at most 20.
- The merging will be done in a way that chapters are as balanced as possible in length, but still preserve topic boundaries as much as possible.
- If the video is short, there can be fewer than 20 chapters.
- If the video is long, the chapters will be merged to cover the whole video in 20 or fewer chapters, with variable lengths.

I’ll update the `_generate_chapters` method to include this logic.

```python
    def _generate_chapters(self, transcription: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Generate chapters from transcription with minimum length enforcement and a maximum of 20 chapters."""

Your requirements are now implemented:

- Chapters will be at least 1 minute long.
- If the number of chapters exceeds 20, the script will merge adjacent chapters (preferring to merge the shortest ones) until there are at most 20 chapters.
- The entire video will be covered, and chapter lengths will vary as needed to fit the video into 20 or fewer chapters.

You can now process long videos and the output will never exceed 20 chapters, with each chapter being as balanced as possible in length while still respecting topic boundaries.

Let me know if you want to adjust the maximum number of chapters, the minimum chapter length, or the merging strategy!

It seems the script is stuck after generating the chapters. Let's add some debug logging to see where exactly it's getting stuck and also add a timeout mechanism. I'll modify the code to add more progress information and error handling:

```

I've added detailed logging throughout the process to help identify where the script might be getting stuck. I've also improved the timestamp formatting and export functions.

Let's also modify the example.py to add a timeout mechanism:


```python
from chapter_generator import VideoChapterGenerator
import os
import argparse
import signal
from contextlib import contextmanager
import time

@contextmanager
def timeout(seconds):
    def signal_handler(signum, frame):
        raise TimeoutError("Timed out!")
    signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, signal_handler)
    signal.alarm(seconds)
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        signal.alarm(0)

def process_video(generator, video_path):
    """Process a video and generate chapters."""
    print(f"\nProcessing video: {video_path}")
    try:
        # Set a timeout of 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
        with timeout(1800):
            # Generate chapters
            chapters = generator.process_video(video_path)
            
            # Export in different formats
            print("\nExporting chapters...")
            generator.export_youtube_format(chapters, "chapters_youtube.txt")
            generator.export_srt(chapters, "chapters.srt")
            generator.export_json(chapters, "chapters.json")
            
            print("\nGenerated chapters:")
            for i, chapter in enumerate(chapters, 1):
                print(f"\nChapter {i}:")
                print(f"Title: {chapter['title']}")
                print(f"Time: {chapter['start_time']:.2f}s - {chapter['end_time']:.2f}s")
                print(f"Description: {chapter['description'][:100]}...")
    except TimeoutError:
        print("\nError: Processing took too long (timeout after 30 minutes)")
        print("Try using a smaller model size (e.g., --model tiny)")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\nError: {str(e)}")

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Generate video chapters from local video or YouTube URL')
    parser.add_argument('--video', '-v', help='Path to local video file')
    parser.add_argument('--youtube', '-y', help='YouTube video URL')
    parser.add_argument('--model', '-m', default='base', choices=['tiny', 'base', 'small', 'medium', 'large'],
                      help='Whisper model size (default: base)')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if not args.video and not args.youtube:
        print("Please provide either a local video file or a YouTube URL")
        parser.print_help()
        return
    
    # Initialize the chapter generator
    generator = VideoChapterGenerator(model_size=args.model)
    
    # Process local video if provided
    if args.video:
        if not os.path.exists(args.video):
            print(f"Error: Video file not found: {args.video}")
            return
        process_video(generator, args.video)
    
    # Process YouTube video if provided
    if args.youtube:
        process_video(generator, args.youtube)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

I've made several improvements:

1. Added detailed logging throughout the process to help identify where the script might be getting stuck
2. Added a 30-minute timeout mechanism
3. Improved error handling and reporting
4. Added better progress messages

Try running the script again with a smaller model size:

```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model tiny
```

The script should now either:
1. Complete successfully with detailed progress messages
2. Timeout after 30 minutes with a helpful message
3. Show exactly where it's getting stuck if there's an error

If it still gets stuck, the detailed logging will help us identify exactly where the issue is occurring. Let me know what output you see and we can further diagnose the issue.

Ah, I apologize - the `SIGALRM` signal is not available on Windows. Let's modify the timeout mechanism to work on Windows using a different approach:

        with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:

            except TimeoutError:

    parser.add_argument('--model', '-m', default='base', choices=['tiny', 'base', 'small', 'medium', 'large'],
                      help='Whisper model size (default: base)')
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    if not args.video and not args.youtube:
        print("Please provide either a local video file or a YouTube URL")
        parser.print_help()
        return
    
    # Initialize the chapter generator
    generator = VideoChapterGenerator(model_size=args.model)
    
    # Process local video if provided
    if args.video:
        if not os.path.exists(args.video):
            print(f"Error: Video file not found: {args.video}")
            return
        process_video(generator, args.video)
    
    # Process YouTube video if provided
    if args.youtube:
        process_video(generator, args.youtube)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

I've replaced the Unix-specific signal-based timeout with a Windows-compatible threading-based timeout using `ThreadPoolExecutor`. This should work on Windows now.

Try running the command again:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model tiny
```

The script will now:
1. Use a thread-based timeout mechanism that works on Windows
2. Still timeout after 30 minutes if processing takes too long
3. Show detailed progress messages throughout the process

If you still encounter any issues, please let me know what error you see and I'll help you resolve it.

Looking at the output, it seems the script has completed the transcription phase (which took about 5 minutes and 33 seconds) and is now in the "Generating chapters" phase. The progress bar shows 100% but it might be stuck in the chapter generation or export phase.

Let's add more granular progress indicators to the chapter generation and export process. I'll modify the code to show more detailed progress:


```python
    def _generate_chapters(self, transcription: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Generate chapters from transcription with minimum length enforcement and a maximum of 20 chapters."""
        print("Starting chapter generation process...")
        segments = transcription["segments"]
        if not segments:
            print("No segments found in transcription")
            return []
            
        print(f"Processing {len(segments)} segments...")
        chapters = []
        MIN_CHAPTER_LENGTH = 60  # Minimum chapter length in seconds
        MAX_CHAPTERS = 20
        
        # Group segments into potential chapters
        print("Grouping segments into initial chapters...")
        current_chapter = {
            "start_time": segments[0]["start"],
            "end_time": segments[0]["end"],
            "text": segments[0]["text"],
            "segments": [segments[0]]
        }
        
        for i, segment in enumerate(segments[1:], 1):
            if i % 10 == 0:  # Progress update every 10 segments
                print(f"Processing segment {i}/{len(segments)}...")
            
            # Check for topic transition and minimum length
            if (self._is_topic_transition(current_chapter["text"], segment["text"]) and 
                (segment["start"] - current_chapter["start_time"]) >= MIN_CHAPTER_LENGTH):

```

I've added detailed progress messages throughout the chapter generation process. Now you'll be able to see exactly what's happening at each step. Try running the command again:

```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model tiny
```

You should now see detailed progress messages showing:
1. How many segments are being processed
2. When chapters are being merged
3. The chapter count at each stage
4. When the process completes

This will help us identify if and where the script is getting stuck. If it appears to be stuck, we'll be able to see exactly at which step it's happening. Let me know what output you see with these new progress messages.

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model tiny
```

why does it say device using cpu 

---

**Cursor**

The message "Device set to use cpu" appears because the script is using the CPU for processing instead of a GPU. This is determined by this line in the `VideoChapterGenerator` class:

```python
self.device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
```

This means:
1. If CUDA (NVIDIA GPU support) is available, it will use the GPU
2. If CUDA is not available, it will fall back to CPU

The script is using CPU because either:
1. You don't have an NVIDIA GPU
2. You have an NVIDIA GPU but CUDA is not properly installed
3. You have an NVIDIA GPU but PyTorch wasn't installed with CUDA support

To use GPU acceleration, you would need:
1. An NVIDIA GPU
2. CUDA toolkit installed
3. PyTorch installed with CUDA support

If you want to check if you have a compatible GPU and CUDA installed, you can run:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

If you want to use GPU acceleration, you would need to:
1. Install NVIDIA drivers
2. Install CUDA toolkit
3. Reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support:
```bash
pip uninstall torch
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

Would you like me to help you set up GPU acceleration if you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU?

```python
self.device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
```

```shellscript
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

```shellscript
pip uninstall torch
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

**User**

 python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
CUDA available: False

---

**Cursor**

This output confirms that CUDA is not available on your system, which means either:

1. You don't have an NVIDIA GPU, or
2. You have an NVIDIA GPU but CUDA is not properly installed

To check if you have an NVIDIA GPU, you can run:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

If this command is not recognized, it likely means you don't have an NVIDIA GPU installed. In this case, the script will continue to use CPU processing, which is why you see "Device set to use cpu".

Using CPU is perfectly fine, but it will be slower than GPU processing. The current processing times you're seeing are normal for CPU processing. If you want to speed up the process, you can:

1. Use a smaller model size (which you're already doing with `--model tiny`)
2. Process shorter videos
3. If you have an NVIDIA GPU, we can help set up CUDA support

Would you like me to help you with any of these options? Or would you like to continue with CPU processing as is?

```shellscript
nvidia-smi
```

I see you have an RTX 3060 with 6GB VRAM, which is perfect for this task. The issue is that PyTorch isn't installed with CUDA support. Let's fix this:

1. First, uninstall the current PyTorch installation:
```bash
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
```

2. Then install PyTorch with CUDA support. Since you have CUDA 12.8, we'll use the latest compatible version:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

3. After installation, verify CUDA is available:
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

This should now return `True`. After this, when you run the script:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model tiny
```

You should see "Device set to use cuda" instead of CPU, and the processing should be significantly faster.

The RTX 3060 is a powerful GPU that should handle this task very well. You might even be able to use larger models (like 'base' or 'small') with good performance. Would you like me to help you with any of these steps?

```shellscript
pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
```

```shellscript
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
```

```shellscript
python -c "import torch; print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model tiny
```

the accuracy being pulled from the video or the audio is not up to the mark as in what is being said in the video it is being transcribed with a lot low accuracy also the titles of the videos are very long and the descriptions of the videos are very short fix these things

I'll help improve the transcription accuracy and make the chapter titles and descriptions more balanced. Let's make several improvements:

1. First, let's improve the transcription accuracy by using a better model and adding some preprocessing:

I've made several important improvements:

1. **Better Transcription Accuracy**:
   - Upgraded the default model from 'tiny' to 'base' for better accuracy
   - Added language specification for English
   - Enabled beam search and multiple samples
   - Added context awareness
   - Used full precision for better accuracy
   - Added an initial prompt to guide the model

2. **Better Chapter Titles**:
   - Limited title length to 50 characters
   - Added better text cleaning
   - Improved title selection logic
   - Removed unnecessary numbers and special characters
   - Better handling of long sentences

3. **Better Chapter Descriptions**:
   - Increased minimum description length to 50 characters
   - Increased maximum length to 150 characters
   - Added better summarization parameters
   - Added fallback to include more context if summary is too short
   - Better text cleaning and formatting

4. **Better Topic Transition Detection**:
   - Added more transition words and phrases
   - Improved context awareness

Try running the script again with these improvements:
```bash
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model base
```

The output should now have:
- More accurate transcriptions
- Shorter, more concise chapter titles
- Longer, more detailed chapter descriptions
- Better chapter segmentation

Let me know if you'd like any adjustments to these parameters or if you notice any other issues!

```shellscript
python example.py --youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGcESPltM&t=1s" --model base
```

**User**

accuracy and title is good but i need a little bit more detail and information on the descriptions of the chapters

**Cursor**

I'll modify the description generation to provide more detailed and informative chapter descriptions. I'll increase the length and improve the summarization parameters:


```python
    def _generate_description(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Generate a detailed and informative description for the chapter."""
        # Clean the text
        text = text.strip()
        
        # If text is too short, return as is
        if len(text) < 100:
            return text
            
        try:
            # First, try to get a comprehensive summary
            summary = self.summarizer(
                text,
                max_length=250,  # Increased from 150 to 250 for more detail
                min_length=100,  # Increased from 50 to 100 for more detail
                do_sample=False, # Deterministic output
                num_beams=5,     # Increased from 4 to 5 for better quality
                length_penalty=2.5, # Increased to encourage longer summaries
                early_stopping=True
            )[0]["summary_text"]
            
            # If the summary is still too short, add more context
            if len(summary) < 150:
                sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
                if len(sentences) > 1:
                    # Add the next two sentences for more context
                    additional_context = " ".join(sentences[1:3])
                    summary = summary + " " + additional_context
            
            # Ensure the description has enough detail
            if len(summary) < 150:
                # Try to extract key points
                key_points = []
                for sentence in sent_tokenize(text):
                    # Look for sentences that might contain important information
                    if any(keyword in sentence.lower() for keyword in 
                          ["because", "therefore", "however", "although", "despite", 
                           "important", "key", "main", "primary", "significant"]):
                        key_points.append(sentence)
                        if len(key_points) >= 2:  # Add up to 2 key points
                            break
                
                if key_points:
                    summary = summary + " " + " ".join(key_points)
            
            # Clean up the final description
            summary = summary.strip()
            # Remove any duplicate sentences
            sentences = sent_tokenize(summary)
            unique_sentences = []
            for sentence in sentences:
                if sentence not in unique_sentences:
                    unique_sentences.append(sentence)
            summary = " ".join(unique_sentences)
            
            # Ensure the description is not too long
            if len(summary) > 300:
                summary = summary[:297] + "..."
            
            return summary
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in description generation: {str(e)}")
            # If summarization fails, return a cleaned version of the text
            # Try to get a good portion of the text that makes sense
            sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
            if len(sentences) >= 3:
                return " ".join(sentences[:3])  # Return first three sentences
            return text[:300].strip()  # Limit to 300 characters if summarization fails
```

Let me try again with a different approach:


```python
    def _generate_description(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Generate a detailed and informative description for the chapter."""
        # Clean the text
        text = text.strip()
        
        # If text is too short, return as is
        if len(text) < 100:
            return text
            
        try:
            # First, try to get a comprehensive summary
            summary = self.summarizer(
                text,
                max_length=250,  # Increased from 150 to 250 for more detail
                min_length=100,  # Increased from 50 to 100 for more detail
                do_sample=False, # Deterministic output
                num_beams=5,     # Increased from 4 to 5 for better quality
                length_penalty=2.5, # Increased to encourage longer summaries
                early_stopping=True
            )[0]["summary_text"]
            
            # If the summary is still too short, add more context
            if len(summary) < 150:
                sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
                if len(sentences) > 1:
                    # Add the next two sentences for more context
                    additional_context = " ".join(sentences[1:3])
                    summary = summary + " " + additional_context
            
            # Ensure the description has enough detail
            if len(summary) < 150:
                # Try to extract key points
                key_points = []
                for sentence in sent_tokenize(text):
                    # Look for sentences that might contain important information
                    if any(keyword in sentence.lower() for keyword in 
                          ["because", "therefore", "however", "although", "despite", 
                           "important", "key", "main", "primary", "significant"]):
                        key_points.append(sentence)
                        if len(key_points) >= 2:  # Add up to 2 key points
                            break
                
                if key_points:
                    summary = summary + " " + " ".join(key_points)
            
            # Clean up the final description
            summary = summary.strip()
            # Remove any duplicate sentences
            sentences = sent_tokenize(summary)
            unique_sentences = []
            for sentence in sentences:
                if sentence not in unique_sentences:
                    unique_sentences.append(sentence)
            summary = " ".join(unique_sentences)
            
            # Ensure the description is not too long
            if len(summary) > 300:
                summary = summary[:297] + "..."
            
            return summary
            
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error in description generation: {str(e)}")
            # If summarization fails, return a cleaned version of the text
            # Try to get a good portion of the text that makes sense
            sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
            if len(sentences) >= 3:
                return " ".join(sentences[:3])  # Return first three sentences
            return text[:300].strip()  # Limit to 300 characters if summarization fails
```


Your chapter descriptions will now be much more detailed and informative:

- The summary length is increased (up to 250 characters, minimum 100).
- If the summary is still too short, it adds more context from the next sentences.
- If still not detailed enough, it tries to extract and append key points from the text.
- It removes duplicate sentences and ensures the description is not too long (max 300 characters).
- If summarization fails, it falls back to the first three sentences or up to 300 characters.

This should give you richer, more informative chapter descriptions.  
Try running the script again and let me know if you want even more detail or further adjustments!
